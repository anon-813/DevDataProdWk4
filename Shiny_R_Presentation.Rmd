## Introduction: 

I am a baseball fan and this project creates a simple shiny app that allows us to explore the Teams table in Sean Lahmanâ€™s Baseball Database.  This presentation is the 'Reproducible Pitch' part of my 'Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch' course project.  
 
The next few slides will describe how the Shiny App was created.


## Finding the Data Set

Lahman's database is well known amongst the baseball community and is thankfully provided in the appropriately named "Lahman" package for R.   There are a variety of tables available in the package, but we will just be using the 'Teams' data, which provides yearly statistics and standings for baseball teams.  </br>
More information on the data can be found on <a href='http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/'>  Lahman's Site </a>


## The App

The database includes data from 1871 to 2019.   The first slider that allows us to select only data between any 2 years that we select.  </br>

The app creates a scatter plot based upon the x and y variables that we select.  This plot is displayed on the Plot tab of the app.   </br>

It also creates a histogram for a variable of our choice.   The histogram is displayed on the histogram tab and we can select the number of bins to display.
